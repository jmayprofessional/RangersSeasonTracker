a python based command line designed to connect and interpret NHL api data for the New York Rangers team
# How to use this program
please open the script named puckLineStats.py and run it by using the command `python puckLineStats.py` in your command prompt. 
this should display a list of four options you can choose from to see current New York Rangers Stats powered by the NHL API (link at bottom for reference):

#Things to do
I would like to expand on this project and add additional stat lines in addition to the ability to compare and contrast games
I would like to expand on this project by adding a UI to take the place of the command line tool
I would like to expand on this project by adding individual player stats and the ability to search for each.
